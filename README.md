## How it works

The script pulls all 5 letter words from any webpage and uses them for a game of Wordle. Perfect for use on text-heavy sites like wikipedia using tampermonkey's @match feature. Example: @match https://en.wikipedia.org/*

## How to use:

Two ways to play:

- Copy and paste either boredle.js or bordle.min.js into your browser's console
- Use the [tampermonkey chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) to run the script on every page using @match *://*/* 

## Features:

- Increase size with green window button
- Decrease size with yellow window button
- Pin in place with the pin ðŸ“Œ button, click again to float in bottom right corner
